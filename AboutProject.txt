The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with
fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player.

It is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions, and in some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that competing players use one hand to form
one of three shapes at an agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a
simple game that anybody can play and win. There is no obvious advantage to the stronger, older, more experienced opponent.
